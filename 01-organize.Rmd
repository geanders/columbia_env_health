# Organize {#organize}

`r newthought("If you are using R to write")` for larger projects, including research 
for academic papers and theses, you should start putting some thought into how you 
organize your research files, including raw data, cleaned data, coding scripts for 
analysis, and output like paper drafts and figures. 

## R Projects

`r newthought("RStudio allows you to")` create "Projects", which help with this organization.

### Keeping things tidy

My desk at work is very messy, with lots of paper printouts piled up. My car and my closet 
aren't terribly tidy, either. But I do keep my project directories very tidy, and I 
strongly recommend the practice. 

This goes beyond "well-organized", which we just covered (putting all project
files in one directory, using subdirectories to divide up files in a project, 
using consistent names for project file directories, etc.). Keeping a project directory
"tidy" means having **only one** version of each file. Often, as you develop a project, 
especially when collaborators are involved, you can end up with many versions of a 
file. For example, you may have the draft of a journal article's text saved 
in some versions with the file name reflecting the date of the draft ("draft_may_12.docx"), 
some versions that include the initials of people who reviewed it ("paper_draft_ba_rp_mb2.docx"), 
and so on. 

This type of organization---having multiple versions of project files, with the file names 
meant to help you keep track of them---results in very cluttered and hard-to-manage project
directories. Instead, at any given moment, each of your project directories should have only
one version of each project file. You certainly won't want to lose information from edits 
and changes to the files along the way, so it's smart to use some type of **version control
system**[**version control system.** ...] on each project directory. This will allow you 
to track the changes you've made to each file and to go back and revisit the file at any 
moment in the project's history. A later section of this booklet will describe how you can 
use `git` for version control for R projects. 

### Avoiding repetition

One key to efficient organization is to **avoid repetition**.^[In programming, you'll often 
hear this advice as "Do Not Repeat Yourself".] In practice, it often happens that you're using the
same code across several projects. For example, say you have some code that calculates the
apparent temperature from air temperature and some measure of dewpoint temperature. If you have
organized your project files to have one directory per paper, with all the associated code for 
a paper within the project's directory, then you may find you're often copying and pasting the
code to calculate apparent temperature into different directories. 

This situation makes for a tricky balance---you want to organize your files and have a separate
directory for each project, but cutting and pasting code can be a recide for disaster. Each time
you move the code, there's a chance for an error to slip in. Also, what if you want to make a change 
in the code? Say you hear about a better algorithm for calculating apparent temperature?
You will either need to go through all of your projects that use that code and change the code
everywhere, or you will have to settle for different projects using different algorithms. 

This means it's time to start thinking about writing your own **R package**.[@**R package** ...]
You do not have to publish every R package you write---it's fine to just use it yourself and not
share it more widely. Regardless, a package is the right place to store related code that you use
often, as well as documentation (and possibly tests) to go with that code. A later section of this 
booklet will go over a bit about how to write your own R packages, as well as references for 
learning more about package development.
