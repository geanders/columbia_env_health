# Package {#package}

`r newthought("As with many other things in R,")` the threshold of complexity
for writing your own package has recently lowered dramatically. If you are writing
some of your own functions in R to use for your research, and you've become comfortable
with writing functions, you should try putting them in an R package. You don't have
to share this package through publishing it on CRAN or another repository---instead, it's 
fine to start by just writing packages for your own use, or for your research group's 
private use. However, once you start writing packages, you will see how straightforward
it is, and you may want to take the extra steps to prepare your package for CRAN and 
submit it.

### Why publish your packages?


### Where to publish packages


### Extra steps for publishing

If you want to submit your package to CRAN, you'll need to take a few extra steps
to get it ready. These steps aren't necessary for a package you plan to just
use privately, but they wouldn't be a bad idea to try to do even in that case. 

First, you'll need to make sure that the functions in your package are 
comprehensively documented. [What are requirements for this for CRAN?]

In addition to documenting specific functions, you should also consider
writing overall tutorials that walk a user through how to use your 
package in a few example scenarios. **vignette**^[**vignette.** ...]

You will also need to make sure that your package can run on different 
operating systems. If your package only has functions written exclusively 
in R, and doesn't interact with [the computer system?] or other programs
on your computer, this shouldn't be an issue. However, you should still 
check. [Travis CI, winbuilder]

One wonderful resource for writing and publishing R packages is the book [R
Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham. This book is available
for a reasonable price in paperback (many Barnes & Nobles carry it in their
computer section) and is also available for free online. The author of this book
also created and maintains the **`devtools` package**^[**`devtools` package.**
An R package with functions that facilitate R package development. These
functions are well-documented in the package documentation as well as through
the book [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). This package also includes a
function for installing R packages from code posted on GitHub
(`install_github`), which is very useful if you want to find and use packages
that are not yet available on CRAN and other repositories or if you want to use
the latest, "development" version of a package. This package is available on
CRAN and so can be installed with `install.packages("devtools")`.]
