You can download the slides from the workshop by clicking here. There are some additional topics in R that would also be useful for environmental health researchers that I won’t cover here. I would, however, suggest that you look at the latest on tidyverse functions for cleaning and visualizing data (the dplyr and ggplot2 packages are at the heart of this), new developments on working with geospatial data with the sf package, creating interactive graphics with htmlwidgets, and creating reports, blogs, and books through the rmarkdown framework. In the conclusion to this booklet, I’ll provide some references for learning more about all of these topics. Click on the Next button (or navigate using the links at the top of the page) to continue. 1.1 Set-up I am assuming that you already have R and RStudio installed on your computer. You may want to check that you have a recent version of both, and if not, update you version before the workshop. Some of the packages and RStudio tools we’ll be using will require newer versions of R and RStudio to work. You can run sessionInfo() in R to find out the version of R you have installed. Compare this version to the latest R release version listed at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)1 To try out the examples, you will also need a bit more set-up: Download git Get a GitHub account Install some R packages Download example R Project This section will walk you through each step. Download git In the workshop, you will learn how to use git.[^git. Open-source version control software …] To try the examples, you will need to install git to your computer and make sure that your installation of RStudio can find this software, so you can use git for version control for R Projects. … Get a GitHub account You’ll also learn how to share and collaborate on an R Project using GitHub.2 You will need to get a GitHub account to be able to post repositories on GitHub. … Install some R packages This booklet uses a number of R packages beyond base R. To install all the packages that you’ll need, run the following code in your version of R: install.packages(c(&quot;readr&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;forcats&quot;, &quot;magrittr&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;lubridate&quot;, &quot;sf&quot;, &quot;tigris&quot;, &quot;DT&quot;, &quot;plotly&quot;, &quot;leaflet&quot;, &quot;flexdashboard&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;stringr&quot;)) Download example R Project I’ve created a repository on GitHub. You can find this example repository by clicking here. On the page takes you to, click on the “Clone or download” button and then select “Download ZIP”. This will download a single zipped file to your computer. When you unzip the file, it will be a special type of directory, an R Project directory. To open the R Project and start on the examples, open RStudio, then go to “File” -&gt; “Open Project”. A pop-up window will open to let you navigate through your files and find an R Project to open. Navigate to the directory you downloaded, which should be called “columbia_env_health_examples” and doubleclick on the file in this directory called “columbia_env_health_examples.Rproj”. This will open the project. In the “Files” pane of RStudio, you should see some subdirectories for “R” and “data”. These have the example R code and data, respectively, for you to try the examples in this booklet. The code in each of the R files should run independently, including the code to load all required packages. Figure 1.1 shows what this package should look like once you’ve downloaded and opened it, as well as some of the files in the project’s “R” subdirectory.

An online platform for directories tracked with the version control software git. This platform has become very popular for sharing code projects, as well as collaborating across a team on developing code and software. Other online git platforms exist and are used by some researchers, including GitLab. Once you’ve mastered using GitHub, you should be able to easy transfer those skills to other platforms like GitLab.↩ "]
