<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> Track</h1>
<p><span class="newthought">Years ago, I tried to learn to use</span> git version control software with R, and
it was a total fail. Maybe it’s just me, but I found it really hard to wrap my head around
the text-dominated, command-line interface classically used for git. However, RStudio now
includes tools that provide a GUI-style
interface to most of the functionality you’ll need from git for R-based projects. I highly
recommend trying git by using it through RStudio first, and then once you develop a mental
map of what’s going on, it’s much easier to transfer partially or completely to running git
from a shell.</p>
<p>In this part, I’ll discuss both git (the software that allows you to track changes to your
R projects), as well as GitHub (an online platform for sharing and collaborating on
version-controlled projects). I’ll also discuss, near the end, how to use either a Bash
Shell or the <code>git2r</code> package to do some one-off git tasks that can’t be done directly through
the RStudio GUI-style git interface.</p>
<div id="git" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> git</h2>
<p>Git is a version control system. It saves information about all changes you make
on all files in a repository. This allows you to revert back to previous
versions and search through the history for all files in the repository. Git is
open source. You can download it for different operating systems at
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>. You will need git on your computer to use git
with RStudio and create local git repositories you can sync with GitHub
repositories. If you are using Windows OS, you’ll want your git installation to
include a “Bash emulation” (i.e., access to a command line that acts like a Bash
shell), which I think should come standard with the Windows git installation.
On Mac or Linux computers, you should already have access to a Bash shell.</p>
<div id="configuring-git" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Configuring git</h3>
<p>Before you use git, you should configure it. For example, you should make sure
it has your name and email address. You can configure git with commands at a
Bash shell.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> For example, I
would run the following code at a shell to configure git to have my proper user
name and email:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name &quot;Brooke Anderson&quot;
git config --global user.email &quot;brooke.anderson@colostate.edu&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You’ll only need to run this configuration once, until you get a new computer or
for some reason need to re-install git. Once you set these configurations on
your computer, they should be set on that computer indefinitely.</p>
<p>Next, you need to make sure that RStudio can find the git software you
installed. Sometimes, RStudio will automatically find git (once you’ve installed
git) when you start RStudio. However, in some cases, you may need to take some
more steps to activate git in RStudio. To do this, go to “RStudio” -&gt;
“Preferences” -&gt; “Git/SVN”. Choose “Enable version control”. If you have just
installed git, and have not restarted RStudio, you’ll need to do that before
RStudio will recognize git. If you do not see “Git” in the box for “Version
control system”, it means either that you do not have git installed on your
computer or that RStudio was unable to find it. If RStudio doesn’t find your
version of git in the “Git executable” box, browse for it. If you’re still
having problems, there’s a chance that you’ll need to mess around some with your
PATH variables. You may want to find a computer-savy friend or IT person to help
you if you get to this stage.</p>
</div>
<div id="tracking-an-r-project" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Tracking an R project</h3>
<p>To track an R package, you’ll first need to initialize it as a git repository.
Then, as you make changes to the code, you’ll want to <strong>commit</strong> those changes
as you go, using <strong>commit messages</strong> that are short but clear enough for you to
follow them when you review them later.</p>
<p>You can initialize a git repository for a directory that is an R Project
directory through R Studio.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open the Project.</li>
<li>Go to “Tools” -&gt; “Version Control” -&gt; “Project Setup”.</li>
<li>In the box for “Version control system”, choose “Git”.</li>
</ol>
<p>You only need to do this once per project, but you will need to do it for each
project you want to keep under version control.</p>
<p>Once you initialize the project as a git repository, you should have a “Git”
window in one of your RStudio panes (top right pane by default). As you make and
save changes to files, they will show up in this window for you to commit. When
you want git to record changes, you <em>commit</em> the files with the changes. Each
time you commit, you have to include a short commit message with some
information about the changes. You can make commits from a shell. However, it’s
much easier to just make commits from the RStudio environment. Click on the
“Commit” button in the Git window. That will open a separate commit window. In
this window, to commit changes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click on the files you want to commit to select them.</li>
<li>If you’d like, you can use the bottom part of the window to look through the
changes you are committing in each file.</li>
<li>Write a message in the “Commit message” box. Keep the message to one line in
this box if you can. If you need to explain more, write a short one-line
message, skip a line, and then write a longer explanation.</li>
<li>Click on the “Commit” button on the right.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you commit changes to files, they will disappear from the Git window until
you make and save more changes in them.</p>
<p>Once you’ve made some commits, you may want to browse through the changes. On
the top left of the Commit window, you can toggle to “History”. This window
allows you to explore the history of commits for the repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="github" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> GitHub</h2>
<p>GitHub is an online platform for hosting directories under git version control.
It allows you to host git repositories online. This allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work collaboratively on a shared repository</li>
<li>Fork someone else’s repository to create your own copy that you can use and change as you want</li>
<li>Suggest changes to other people’s repositories through pull requests</li>
</ul>
<p>To push local repositories to GitHub and fork other people’s repositories, you
will need a GitHub account. You can sign up at <a href="https://github.com" class="uri">https://github.com</a>. A free
account is fine.</p>
<p>The basic unit for working in GitHub is the repository. You can think of a
repository as very similar to an R Project—it’s a directory of files with
some supplemental files saving some additional information about the directory
(and I recommend making any directory with R code that you plan to track with
git and GitHub as an R project, although it isn’t technically required).</p>
<p>While R Projects have this additional information saved as “.RProj” files, git
repositories have this information in a directory called “.git”. Because this
pathname starts with a dot, it won’t show up in many of the ways you list files
in a directory.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>If you have a local directory that you would like to push to GitHub, these are
the steps to do it. First, you need to make sure that the directory is under git
version control. See the notes on initializing a repository. Next, you need to
create an empty repository on GitHub to sync with your local repository. Do that
by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In GitHub, click on the “+” in the upper right corner (“Create new”).</li>
<li>Choose “Create new repository”.</li>
<li>Give your repository the same name as the local directory you’d like to
connect it to. For example, if you want to connect it to a directory called
“fars_analysis” on your computer, name the repository “fars_analysis”.</li>
<li>Leave everything else as-is (unless you’d like to add a short description in
the “Description” box). Click on “Create repository” at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you connect your local repository with the GitHub one, you’ll want to change
some settings in RStudio so GitHub will recognize that your local repository
belongs to you, rather than asking for you password every time.</p>
<ul>
<li>In RStudio, go to “RStudio” -&gt; “Preferences” -&gt; “Git / svn”. Choose to “Create
RSA key”.</li>
<li>Click on “View public key”. Copy what shows up.</li>
<li>Go to your GitHub account and navigate to “Settings”. Click on “SSH and GPG keys”.</li>
<li>Click on “New SSH key”. Name the key something like “RStudio” (you might want
to include the device name if you’ll have SSH keys from RStudio on several
computers). Past in your public key in the “Key box”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you are ready to connect the two repositories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Open a shell and navigate
to the directory you want to push. (You can open a shell from RStudio using the
gear button in the Git window.)</li>
<li>Add the GitHub repository as a remote branch
with the following command (this gives an example for adding a GitHub repository
named “ex_repo” in my GitHub account, “geanders”):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:geanders/ex_repo.git</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Push the contents of the local repository to the GitHub repository.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>git push -u origin master</code></pre>
<p>Once you have linked a local R project with a GitHub repository, you can push
and pull commits using the blue down arrow (pull from GitHub) and green up arrow
(push to GitHub) in the Git window in RStudio.</p>
<p>Each original GitHub repository (i.e., not a fork of another repository) has a
tab for “Issues”. This page works like a Discussion Forum. You can create new
“Issue” threads to describe and discuss things that you want to change about the
repository. Issues can be closed once the problem has been resolved. You can
close issues on the “Issue” page with the “Close issue” button.</p>
<p>GitHub helps you work with others on code. There are two main ways you can do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collaborating:</strong> Different people have the ability to push and pull directly
to and from the same repository. When one person pushes a change to the
repository, other collaborators can immediately get the changes by pulling the
latest GitHub commits to their local repository.</li>
<li><strong>Forking:</strong> Different people have their own GitHub repositories, with each
linked to their own local repository. When a person pushes changes to GitHub, it
only makes changes to his own repository. The person must issue a pull request
to another person’s fork of the repository to share the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the resources in “Learn more” for more on setting up for this kind of collaboration,
including how to resolve merge conflicts when working with collaborators.</p>
</div>
<div id="terminal" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Terminal</h2>
<p>I find that, for 90% of what I want to do in git, I can do it through the GUI-style
interface RStudio provides for git. The few exceptions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting a remote and doing the initial push to that remote</li>
<li>Reverting a commit</li>
<li>Creating a new branch</li>
<li>Merging two branches</li>
</ul>
<p>For these tasks, I usually open up a Bash shell and run a git command from
there. I do this rarely enough that I almost always have to look up the exact
call to use to do the task. I’ve included some resources in “Learn more” that
are good to have around when you find you need to open a Bash shell for a
git-tracked R project.</p>
<p>There’s also a package called <code>git2r</code> that lets you run any of these git
commands from the R command line, so you could also do all these (fairly rare)
tasks from the R console without ever opening a Bash Shell, if you master the
<code>git2r</code> package. See the package’s GitHub page and help documentation
to learn more about how to use this package as an alternative to running R from
the command line.</p>

see that file pop up in the “Git” window of RStudio.</li>
<li>Commit this change using the “Commit” window. After you commit the changes,
look at the “History” window to see the history of your commits.</li>

<ul>
<li>Login to your GitHub account online. Create an empty GitHub repository for the
project (see the notes above). Give it the same name as the name of your R project directory.</li>
<li>If you do not already have an RSA kay, create one in RStudio and add it as an
SSH key in your GitHub settings. If you already have a key (you almost certainly
know if you do), see if you can copy it and submit it in GitHub. (You will only need
to do this step once, not every time you sync a local git repository with a GitHub
repository.)</li>
<li>Set this empty online GitHub repository as the remote branch of your local git
repository for the project using a <code>git remote add origin</code> call at a Bash shell
(see the notes above).</li>
<li>Push your local repository to the GitHub repository using a <code>git push</code> call
(see the notes above).</li>
<li>Go to your GitHub account and make sure the repository was pushed.</li>
<li>Try making some more changes to your local repository. Commit the changes,
then use the green up arrow in the Git window to push the changes to your GitHub
repository.</li>

<p>Hadley Wickham’s excellent book on <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">R Packages</a> includes a great
chapter on <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html">Git and GitHub</a>. While the chapter (and book) is
focused on R packages specifically, the guidance in this chapter would apply to any
R Project directory under version control, whether or not the R Project is for a package.
This book is available free online or as a print version through O’Reilly (and
carried at many Barnes &amp; Nobles).</p>
<p>If you’re using git a lot for R projects, it’s helpful to have some resources available with
more on using git through a Bash Shell. I like the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Guide-Git-Programmers/dp/1934356727/ref=sr_1_28?keywords=git&amp;qid=1554173700&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-28">Pragmatic Guide to Git</a> by Travis Swicegood for a quick, short reference and
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Git-Practice-Techniques-Mike-McQuaid/dp/1617291978/ref=sr_1_60?keywords=git&amp;qid=1554174811&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-60">Git in Practice</a> by Mike McQuaid if I’m trying to dig a bit deeper
and figure out how git works.
I have also heard good things about <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> by Scott Chacon and
Ben Straub, which is available for free online.</p>
<p>However, these resources are all geared to those using git for its original purpose of
tracking changes in software development projects. When you use git to track files for a research
project (rather than, for example, for a repository for an R package you’re writing), you
may have some needs that don’t come up under software development. A few articles have come
out recently that give advice on using git specifically to track research projects—these provide
helpful advice specific to this use of git, which you won’t find in books about git, including
one by RStudio’s Jenny Bryan <span class="citation">(Bryan <a href="#ref-bryan2018excuse">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>
is also invaluable to quickly look up how to do something in git. There are
many tasks in git where I never remember the command, but I do remember enough about what
the functionality is called to be able to quickly use Google to find a StackOverflow thread
that gives me the call. Reading through a book or tutorial on git, even if you don’t
remember the commands you learn, can help you learn some of the vocabulary<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>,
and knowing that vocabulary will help you search for answers when you need them.</p>
<p>Finally, if you can find a way to do it, I think the best and easiest way to learn to use git
and GitHub with R is to collaborate with someone who’s used these tools before. Most of the
time, these tools are very easy to use, but the small percent of the time that they’re not,
it can be significant stumbling blocks (in terms of the time it takes to figure out the fix)
the first few times you use the tools, while someone familiar with them and working on the
project can diagnose and get you over those bumps as you learn the ropes.</p>
