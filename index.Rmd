# Prerequisites

`r newthought("I have based this workshop")` on examples for you to try yourself, 
because you 
won't be able to learn how to program unless you try it out. I've picked 
example data that I hope will be interesting to Navy and Marine Corp public
health researchers and practitioners. You can download the slides from the
workshop by [clicking here](https://github.com/geanders/navy_public_health/raw/master/_workshop_slides/workshop_slides.pdf).

To try out these examples, you need some set-up: 

1. Download R
2. Download RStudio
3. Install some R packages
4. Download example R Project

This section will walk you through each step, explaining both *how* and 
*why* to do the step. 

1. Download R 

R is free and open-source software. You can download a copy for just about any 
operating system at the ]Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)] (https://cran.r-project.org/).
Look for the links on this page to "Download for ..." and your operating system.^[
If your computer has restrictions on what you can download, you may need to take to your
system administrator or IT team to discuss whether you can download and install R and, if 
so, how. In that case, you may also need to talk with them about a strategy for installing
R packages, as well.] 

2. Download RStudio

You do not have to have RStudio^[In this section, I'm referring to RStudio, the software. It is 
produced by a company that is also called "RStudio". RStudio, the company, includes a team of some
of the best and most prolific R programmers currently contributing packages to extend R. A lot of 
the packages covered in this booklet were created and are maintained by members of the RStudio team.]
to run R, but it makes the experience much nicer. I also 
think it's much easier to learn R when using RStudio to run it rather than using R by itself. 

RStudio is an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**^[**Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE).** A program that provides a helpful interface for developing code, often 
geared to a specific programming language. It typically includes tools and a visual 
set-up for the programmer's convenience.] 
You should download it after you have downloaded R. You can download it
[here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop). You want the Desktop, open source 
edition. Download this and install it on your computer as you would any other software package
from a website. 

3. Install some R packages

When you downloaded the R software from CRAN, you downloaded what's called **base R**. This 
is the "engine" to run the heart of R, plus a few key extension packages. There are now
several thousand packages available for R. These packages extend the core functionality of 
R, and we'll be using a lot of these extra packages in this booklet. 

When you need to use an R package that did not come with base R (most of them), you will first
need to **install** it to your computer. This can be done from R with the `install.packages` 
function. This installs a package from an online repository to your computer, saving the code
in a special location that R can find. Since this function is downloading code from online, 
your computer needs to have an internet connection when you run `install.packages`, or you'll
get an error. 

This booklet uses a number of R packages beyond base R. To install all the packages that you'll
need, run the following code in your version of R: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages()
```

4. Download example R Project

I've created a repository on **GitHub**^[**GitHub.** An online platform for directories tracked with 
the version control software `git`. It has become a very popular place for coders to post code 
from their projects, especially for open-source projects like R packages. You may need to get 
a GitHub account to be able to clone this example directory. Even if not, it's not a bad idea to
get an account if you work a lot with data and open-source code.] You can find this example
repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/geanders/navy_public_health_examples). On the
page takes you to, click on the "Clone or download" button and then select "Download ZIP". 

This will download a single zipped file to your computer. When you unzip the file, it will be a
special type of directory, an R Project directory. To open the R Project and start on the 
examples, open RStudio, then go to "File" -> "Open Project". A pop-up window will open to let you 
navigate through your files and find an R Project to open. Navigate to the directory you 
downloaded, which should be called "navy_public_health_examples" and doubleclick on the file 
in this directory called "navy_public_health_examples.Rproj". 

This will open the project. In the "Files" pane of RStudio, you should see some subdirectories for
"R" and "data". These have the example R code and data, respectively, for you to try the examples
in this booklet. The code in each of the R files should run independently, including the code to 
load all required packages. Figure \@ref(fig:examplerepo) shows what this package should 
look like once you've downloaded and opened it, as well as opened the "plot.R" file in the 
project's "R" subdirectory.

```{r examplerepo, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "What the example R Project for this booklet should look like once you've downloaded and opened it, as well as opened the 'plot.R' file in the project's 'R' subdirectory."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/example_repo.png")
```

Click on the **Next** button (or navigate using the
links at the top of the page) to continue.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'ggplot2', 'readr',
  'forcats', 'magrittr', 'dplyr', 'sf', 'htmlwidgets', 'DT', 'plotly', 
  'leaflet'
), 'packages.bib')
```
